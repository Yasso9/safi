# App Ideas

Random app ideas that might be worth exploring someday.

## Active Considerations

### Markdown Presenter
Turn markdown files into presentations. Like reveal.js but simpler.

**Features:**
- Parse markdown headings as slides
- Clean, minimal theme
- Presenter notes
- Export to PDF

**Why:** Existing tools are too complex. Just want markdown → slides.

**Effort:** Medium
**Impact:** Low-medium

### Personal API Gateway
Self-hosted API aggregator for personal services.

**Use case:** Single endpoint that talks to:
- Weather API
- Calendar
- Task manager
- News feeds
- Whatever you connect

**Why:** Tired of managing multiple API keys and services across devices.

**Effort:** High
**Impact:** Medium (niche audience)

## Backburner

### Local-First Habit Tracker
- No cloud sync
- No streaks or gamification
- Just data and trends
- Export to CSV

### CLI for Common Tasks
Wrapper around frequently used commands with better UX.

### Bookmarks Manager
Because browser bookmarks are a mess and Pinboard is outdated.

### RSS Reader
Yes, another one. But minimal and self-hosted.

## Abandoned

### Note-Taking App
Already building Safi. One is enough.

### Time Tracker
Too many good options already exist (Toggl, Clockify, etc.)

## Evaluation Criteria

Before starting any project:
1. **Do I need this?** - Scratch your own itch first
2. **Does it exist?** - If yes, is it actually good?
3. **Can I maintain it?** - Long-term commitment
4. **Is it minimal?** - Complexity is the enemy

Most ideas should die in this file. That's okay.
