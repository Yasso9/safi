# Blog Post Ideas

Writing ideas for technical blog and personal site.

## Ready to Write

### "Why I Built Another Markdown Editor"
**Angle:** The journey of Safi - scratching my own itch

**Outline:**
- The problem with existing editors
- Mobile-first approach
- Self-hosting matters
- Lessons learned from building it

**Target length:** 1000-1500 words
**Status:** Notes in [[Safi Development]]

### "Docker for the Reluctant Developer"
**Angle:** You don't need to be a DevOps expert

**Outline:**
- Basic Dockerfile patterns
- Common pitfalls I hit
- GitHub Container Registry workflow
- When NOT to use Docker

**Target length:** 800-1000 words
**Status:** Can pull from [[Docker Deployment]]

## In Development

### "The Joy of Boring Technology"
**Core idea:** Using proven, stable tech lets you focus on the product

**Rough thoughts:**
- Nuxt, Vue, Tailwind - all "boring" choices
- No bleeding edge experiments
- Productivity over novelty
- When to use new tech vs established

**Needs:** More concrete examples, personal stories

### "Mobile-First Isn't Just Responsive Design"
**Core idea:** Touch interactions, thumb zones, context of use

**Rough thoughts:**
- Why I made Safi mobile-first
- Common mistakes (tiny buttons, hover states)
- Testing on real devices
- Performance on slow connections

**Needs:** Screenshots, real examples

## Seeds (Need More Thought)

- "The Case for File-Based Storage"
- "Reading Code Is a Skill"
- "Why I Stopped Using Notion"
- "Plain Text for the Win"
- "Building in Public: One Month In"
- "The Minimalist Development Stack"
- "Self-Hosting for Privacy and Control"

## Writing Principles

1. **Write for past me** - What would have helped me a year ago?
2. **Show, don't tell** - Code examples, screenshots, real use cases
3. **Be specific** - Vague advice is worthless
4. **Short is fine** - 500 good words beats 2000 mediocre ones
5. **Edit ruthlessly** - Cut the fluff

## Publishing Strategy

- Write on personal site
- Cross-post to Dev.to, Hashnode
- Share on Twitter/Mastodon
- No SEO optimization obsession
- Focus on helping, not traffic
