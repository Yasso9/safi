# Getting Things Done (GTD) Method

Notes on David Allen's productivity system.

## Core Principles

GTD is about capturing everything in a trusted system so your mind is free to focus on the work itself, not remembering what needs to be done.

## The Five Steps

### 1. Capture
Collect anything that has your attention. Use:
- Inbox (physical and digital)
- Notes app
- Voice memos
- Email

**Key rule:** Get it out of your head immediately.

### 2. Clarify
Process what each item means and what to do about it.

**Decision tree:**
- Is it actionable?
  - **No** → Trash, someday/maybe, or reference
  - **Yes** → What's the next action?
    - < 2 minutes? Do it now
    - Delegate? Track it
    - Defer? Add to action list

### 3. Organize
Put items where they belong:
- **Projects list** - Anything requiring > 1 action
- **Next actions** - By context (@computer, @home, @errands)
- **Waiting for** - Delegated items
- **Someday/maybe** - Future possibilities
- **Calendar** - Time-specific items only
- **Reference** - Supporting materials

### 4. Reflect
Review regularly:
- **Daily** - Check calendar and next actions
- **Weekly** - Full system review
  - Review all projects
  - Check waiting-for list
  - Look at someday/maybe
  - Process inboxes to zero

### 5. Engage
Choose what to do based on:
1. Context (where you are, tools available)
2. Time available
3. Energy level
4. Priority

## Key Concepts

### Next Action
Always define the very next physical action for each project. Not "website redesign" but "sketch three layout options."

### Context Lists
Group actions by:
- `@computer` - requires computer
- `@phone` - phone calls
- `@errands` - when out
- `@home` - home tasks
- `@waiting` - waiting on others

### Two-Minute Rule
If it takes less than 2 minutes, do it immediately. It takes longer to track it than to just do it.

### Someday/Maybe
Don't let future possibilities clog your active system. Review these periodically.

## Weekly Review

The most important habit. Every week:
1. Get clear - process all inboxes
2. Get current - review action lists
3. Get creative - review projects and someday/maybe

## Tools

GTD is tool-agnostic. Can use:
- Paper system (original method)
- Todoist, Things, OmniFocus
- Notion, Obsidian with task management
- Plain text files with tags

The tool matters less than the habit of processing and reviewing.

## My Implementation

Currently using markdown files in [[Index]] with:
- Daily notes for capture
- Project pages for tracking
- Simple task lists with contexts
- Weekly review on Sundays
