# Note-Taking Systems

Comparison of different note-taking methodologies and philosophies.

## Popular Systems

### Zettelkasten
**Philosophy:** Networked thinking through atomic notes and links.

**Key principles:**
- One idea per note
- Notes in your own words
- Heavy linking between notes
- Permanent notes vs fleeting notes
- Numeric or timestamp IDs

**Best for:** Research, deep thinking, building knowledge over time

**Tools:** Obsidian, The Archive, Zettlr

### PARA Method
**Created by:** Tiago Forte

**Structure:**
- **P**rojects - Active work with deadlines
- **A**reas - Ongoing responsibilities
- **R**esources - Topics of interest
- **A**rchives - Inactive items

**Best for:** Goal-oriented work, project management

### Johnny Decimal
Numeric organization system:
```
10-19 Finance
  11 Tax returns
  12 Bank statements
20-29 Projects
  21 Safi
  22 Website
```

**Best for:** People who think in hierarchies

### Evergreen Notes
**Philosophy:** Write notes as if writing for others. Make them:
- Atomic (one concept)
- Concept-oriented (not source-based)
- Densely linked
- Rewritten over time

**Best for:** Building long-term understanding

## My Hybrid Approach

Combining elements from multiple systems:

1. **Daily notes** for capture (GTD influence)
2. **Project folders** for active work (PARA)
3. **Knowledge base** for evergreen content
4. **Wiki-style links** for connections (Zettelkasten)
5. **Simple folder structure** for discoverability

## Core Principles

### Frictionless Capture
The easier it is to capture, the more likely you'll do it. Don't over-organize upfront.

### Links Over Hierarchy
Files live somewhere, but they connect everywhere. Links create a web of knowledge that folders can't.

### Progressive Summarization
- Layer 1: Original capture
- Layer 2: Bold key points
- Layer 3: Highlight main ideas
- Layer 4: Executive summary

### Write for Future You
Your future self has different context. Write notes that make sense standalone.

## Anti-Patterns

- **Over-organizing** - Spending more time organizing than creating
- **Perfectionism** - Not starting because system isn't perfect
- **Tool hopping** - Constantly switching tools
- **Collection without reflection** - Saving everything, reviewing nothing

## Finding Your System

The best system is the one you'll actually use:
1. Start simple
2. Add complexity only when needed
3. Review and refine regularly
4. Focus on outcomes, not organization
