# Atomic Habits
**Author:** James Clear
**Status:** Completed
**Rating:** 5/5

## Summary
Small changes compound into remarkable results. Focus on systems, not goals. Make good habits obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying.

## Key Concepts

### The 1% Rule
Improving 1% each day compounds to 37x better over a year. Conversely, declining 1% daily leads to nearly zero.

**Formula:** 1.01^365 = 37.78

### Identity-Based Habits
Don't focus on what you want to achieve (outcomes), focus on who you want to become (identity).

- ❌ "I want to run a marathon" (outcome)
- ✅ "I am a runner" (identity)

Every action is a vote for the type of person you want to become.

### The Four Laws of Behavior Change

**To build a good habit:**
1. Make it **obvious** (cue)
2. Make it **attractive** (craving)
3. Make it **easy** (response)
4. Make it **satisfying** (reward)

**To break a bad habit:**
1. Make it invisible
2. Make it unattractive
3. Make it difficult
4. Make it unsatisfying

### Habit Stacking
Link new habits to existing ones:
"After I [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT]."

Examples:
- After I pour my morning coffee, I will meditate for 60 seconds
- After I close my laptop, I will do 10 pushups

### The Two-Minute Rule
When starting a new habit, it should take less than two minutes.

- "Read before bed" → "Read one page"
- "Do yoga" → "Take out my yoga mat"

The point is to show up. You can't improve if you don't start.

### Environment Design
Your environment is the invisible hand that shapes behavior.

- Want to practice guitar? Put it in the middle of the room
- Want to read more? Put books on your pillow
- Want less phone time? Keep it in another room
