## System & Workflow

### Capture
Everything goes into today's daily note first. Process later.

### Daily Review
- Check calendar
- Review today's tasks
- Update project notes

### Weekly Review
Every Sunday:
- Process all daily notes
- Update project statuses
- Review someday/maybe items
- Plan next week

### File Organization
```

## Principles

1. **Write in plain markdown** - No proprietary formats
2. **Link freely** - Create connections between ideas
3. **Review regularly** - Notes without review are worthless
4. **Keep it simple** - Resist over-organization
5. **Future-proof** - Plain text lasts forever
