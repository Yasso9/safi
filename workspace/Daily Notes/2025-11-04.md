## Morning Reflection
Feeling energized today. Planning to make good progress on the Safi project and review some deployment options.

## Tasks
- [x] Review Docker deployment configuration
- [x] Update documentation
- [ ] Plan new features for Q4
- [ ] Research markdown editor alternatives

## Notes
Started exploring different markdown editors to understand what users expect. Key insights:
- Users want **simplicity** over complex features
- Mobile experience is often neglected
- Self-hosting is increasingly important for privacy

## Ideas
- Could add collaborative editing in the future?
- Export functionality (PDF, HTML)

## Evening Review
Productive day overall. Made good progress on documentation. Tomorrow focus on feature planning.
