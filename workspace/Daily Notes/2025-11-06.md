## Today's Focus
Create demo content for Safi and prepare for recording a showcase video.

## Tasks
- [x] Add logo to README
- [ ] Create sample workspace with markdown files
- [ ] Record demo video
- [ ] Research screen recording tools
- [ ] Update project roadmap

## Ideas for Demo
- Show file navigation and organization
- Demonstrate focus mode
- Highlight mobile-friendly design
- Show keyboard shortcuts

## Screen Recording
Looking into Screen Studio alternatives for Linux. Options:
- Demoify (web-based)
- OBS Studio + post-processing
- Kdenlive for editing

The smooth cursor animations on Twitter demos are really appealing. Need to figure out how to achieve that effect.
