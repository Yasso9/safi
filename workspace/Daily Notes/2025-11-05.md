Clear mind, ready to tackle technical challenges. Need to focus on performance optimizations.

## Tasks
- [x] Fix file explorer rendering issues

- [ ] Review accessibility features
- [ ] Write tests for API endpoints

## Work Log
### Safi Development

- Performance is much better now with lazy loading

See [[Safi Development]] for project details.

## Learning
Read an interesting article about [[Building Better Interfaces]] - key takeaway is to remove rather than add.

## Quick Notes
- CodeMirror 6 is powerful but complex
- Need to revisit the theme system
