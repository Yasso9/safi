# Personal Website Redesign

**Status:** Planning
**Started:** November 2025
**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks

## Motivation
Current website feels outdated. Want something minimal, fast, and showcases my work better.

## Design Principles
- **Brutalist minimal** - raw, honest design
- **Fast** - no unnecessary JavaScript
- **Typography-first** - content over decoration
- **Accessible** - works everywhere, for everyone

## Inspiration
- https://motherfuckingwebsite.com (but slightly less aggressive)
- Personal sites by developers I admire
- Swiss design principles

## Content Structure
```
/
├── index (about + featured work)
├── projects
│   ├── safi
│   └── other projects
├── writing
│   └── blog posts
└── contact
```

## Tech Stack Options
1. **Astro** - fast, content-focused, component islands
2. **Hugo** - blazing fast, markdown-based
3. **Plain HTML** - ultimate simplicity

Leaning toward Astro for balance of DX and performance.

## Tasks
- [ ] Sketch layout ideas
- [ ] Choose tech stack
- [ ] Write project descriptions
- [ ] Set up domain and hosting
- [ ] Migrate blog posts
- [ ] Launch!

## Design Notes
- Monospace font everywhere
- Black and white only
- Maybe one accent color
- Large text, lots of whitespace
- No hero sections or unnecessary imagery
